1. a clearly defined objective and scope of what the working groups aims to
   accomplish
1. a list of owners who have agreed to participate in the working group, review
   progress, report progress back to the OCI community, and present the results
   to the TOB once the working group has completed its objectives
1. a list of OCI Projects, non-OCI projects, or organizations sponsoring the
   working group and participating in the implementation and use case
   validation of the work done by the group
1. a set of project rules which govern how contributions to the working group
   will be handled and decisions will be made
1. a working agreement for making progress, which may include weekly meetings,
   dedicated channels for discussions, or a shared repository

## Required information for TOB Release Approval

When an OCI Working Group determines that it has completed its initial work and
is prepared to request TOB approval for the initial release of its outputs as
an OCI Specification or other OCI Project, the OCI Working Group owners will
present to the TOB the following:

* the draft specification or project content
* the validation work which demonstrates real world usability
* the set of maintainers who have agreed to carry the specification forward

There is no requirement that owners or contributors to the OCI Working Group
will continue to be maintainers for an approved OCI Specification or other OCI
Project after TOB approval and release. However, the TOB will consider it a
requirement that any approved OCI Specification or other OCI Project has a dedicated
and active group of maintainers to continue the work.
