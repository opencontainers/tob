## 1. Mission of the Open Container Initiative ("OCI")

The Open Container Initiative provides an open source technical community
within which industry participants may easily contribute to building
vendor-neutral, portable and open specifications, reference implementations,
and tools that deliver on the promise of containers as a source of application
portability backed by a certification program.

The Open Container Initiative does not seek to be a marketing organization,
define a full stack or solution requirements, and will strive to avoid
standardizing technical areas undergoing innovation and debate.

## 2. OCI Projects

a. The OCI will maintain a collection of projects to execute its Mission (“OCI
   Projects”). The initial OCI Projects shall be the specification (“OCI
   Specification”) and runtime (“runc”) projects. When an OCI Project claims
   that a feature is provided from the OCI Specification, all of its
   constituent parts shall comply with the OCI Specification. An OCI project
   may have additional capabilities that are not reflected in the associated
   specification. In this case, it is understood that the specification (and
   any associated test suites) are the standard for judging compliance, not the
   reference implementation.

b. OCI Projects may be modified by the Technical Oversight Board so long as
   such modifications are in the spirit of the original charter. For example,
   the TOB may choose to add a top level Compliance Test Suite project or a
   reference implementation for an optional layer item.

c. Any Member can bring forward a new project proposal to the TOB for review.
   Approval of new OCI Projects requires a two-thirds vote of the TOB.

d. A project need not be contributed to the OCI in order to be deemed compliant
   with an associated OCI specification. For avoidance of doubt, a runtime can
   be compliant with the OCI Specification even if: a)it differs substantially
   from runC, b)it is housed outside the OCI, c)it is licensed differently from
   runC, including if it is licensed under a proprietary license.

e. In order to support d. above, it is expected that:

   - i. there may be functionality in runC that is not included in the
     specification, provided that such functionality does not compromise
     compliance with the specification, and
   - ii. there may be multiple other implementations of the specification that
     also contain functionality not included in the specification, and
   - iii. there will be a strong bias to exclude items from the specification
     in technical areas undergoing significant innovation and debate,
     especially if those areas are likely to be the basis of differentiation
     between competing implementations.

## 3. Membership.

a. The Open Container Initiative shall be composed of:

   - i. OCI Members: Corporate Members of The Linux Foundation that have
     executed an OCI Membership Agreement to sponsor the activities of the OCI
     Community and a certification program through a Trademark Board;
   - ii. an open source, Technical Developer Community (“TDC”), open to any
     individual, whether an employee of an OCI Member or not;
   - iii. a Technical Oversight Board (“TOB”); and
   - iv. A Trademark Board.

b. OCI Members shall be entitled to:

   - i. participate in OCI Trademark Board meetings, OCI Projects, and any
     other activities sponsored by the OCI;
   - ii. identify their company as a member or participant in the OCI;
   - iii. use any approved OCI membership logo in compliance with guidelines
     established by the LF Trademark Board
   - iv. vote in all decisions of the OCI Trademark Board.

c. OCI non-Member Participants shall be entitled to fully participate in all
   OCI Projects subject to the terms of this Charter and any policies adopted
   by the Trademark Board.

## 4. Trademark Board

a. The Trademark Board shall be composed of one representative appointed by
   each OCI Member. A Member may appoint an alternative representative for any
   meeting.

b. Trademark Board meetings may be held in-person or via electronic
   conferencing. The Trademark Board shall establish its own meeting schedule
   and operating procedures.

c. Quorum for holding meetings shall be established when a simple majority of
   Trademark Board representatives is present.

d. The intention is for the OCI to operate by consensus. However, if consensus
   cannot be achieved, the Trademark Board shall vote on a decision. Votes
   either at meetings, via email or electronic voting service, shall be based
   on a one vote per Active Member basis, requiring a simple majority of votes
   cast to pass. An abstain vote equals not voting at all. An Active Member is
   defined as any OCI Member whose representative attended (including by
   telephone or electronic conference or meeting) at least one of the last four
   Trademark Board meetings. An alternative representative’s attendance counts
   as participation for determining whether a Member is an Active Member.

e. The Trademark Board is intended to provide a minimalist governance structure
   around the development and use of the OCI trademarks and shall be
   responsible for:

   - i. creating the OCI trademarks associated with OCI Projects (including the
     OCI Specification Project), the Open Container Format (OCF) or OCI
     certified solutions.
   - ii. creating a certification program establishing the requirements for
     achieving the status of an “OCI Certified Solution” and defining the terms
     for using any OCI trademark(s) for an OCI Certified Solution;
   - iii. approving the use of OCI funds for specific trademark a trademark
     registration program, and for enforcement actions, if any, that may be
     advisable;
   - iv. creating and approving a budget directing the LF how to use the OCI
     funds raised from all sources of revenue;
   - v. organizing and directing marketing initiatives including, but not
     limited to, press releases, website updates, and creation of collateral
     and branding materials;
   - vi. electing a Chair of the Trademark Board each January, or at another
     time of its choosing by an approved vote of the Trademark Board, to
     preside over meetings, set agendas, authorize budgeted expenditures and
     managing any day-to-day operations; and
   - vii. voting on other decisions or matters that may come before the
     Trademark Board, including adopting policies related to the scope of the
     Trademark Board which shall be documented for Members.

f. Any certification program established by the OCI Trademark Board must
   support a vendor-neutral process and requirements, including specifically,
   the ability for solutions to be certified on multiple operating systems and
   usable in multiple environment implementations.

g. Any issues that cannot be resolved by the Trademark Board shall be referred
   to The Linux Foundation for resolution.

h. For avoidance of doubt, OCI membership does not convey any rights to
   directly influence the technical direction of any OCI Project. That
   influence will come through code and specification contributions to the
   technical projects.

## 5. Technical Developer Community

a. The OCI hosts and supports the participation of a technical development
   community (“OCI TDC”) in OCI Projects. The OCI TDC shall be open to any
   developer, end user or subject matter expert that chooses to participate in
   the activities of OCI, regardless of whether the participant is employed by
   an OCI Member company so long as his or her contributions and conduct comply
   with this Charter.

b. The OCI TDC has an established scope of work focused on:

   - i. Creating and maintaining formal specifications (the OCI Specification
     project) for container image formats and runtime, which will allow a
     compliant container to be portable across all major, compliant operating
     systems and platforms without artificial technical barriers;
   - ii. Ensuring that OCI Specifications incorporate and align to the OCI
     Values, as defined in Section 8 below;
   - iii. The TDC will look to agree on a standard set of container actions
     (e.g. start, exec, pause) as well as a runtime environment associated with
     the container runtime;
   - iv. Creating and maintaining test cases that shall serve as the testing
     functions for achieving certification as an OCI Certified Solution;
   - v. Engaging end users for feedback or input on OCI Projects, including,
     but not limited to, relating to usability;
   - vi. Ensuring that all OCI Projects follow and adhere to the OCI IP Policy;
   - vii. Approving releases by OCI Projects;
   - viii. Creating, maintaining and enforcing governance guidelines for the
     TDC, approved by the maintainers, and which shall be posted visibly for
     the TDC. The guidelines shall cover the following:
   - ix. establishing and defining roles and responsibilities (at a minimum, a
     role for committers or maintainers authorized to commit code to the
     codebase);
   - x. defining the process or requirements to take on a role in the TDC (e.g.
     how to become a contributor, or how to become a maintainer);
   - xi. the process by which participants in the TDC may give up or be revoked
     of their roles (e.g. how to remove maintainers); the rules for decision
     making in the TDC; and
   - xii. any workflow or processes participants are expected to follow in
     making or merging contributions.
   - xiii. Attempting to harmonize the OCI Specifications with other proposed
     standards, including, but not limited to, the appc specification;
   - xiv. Ensuring that the scope of technologies promulgated and proposed as
     standard elements of OCI Projects (including the OCI Specification) are
     those that are sufficiently widespread and sufficiently mature and stable
     so as to warrant establishment in the specification;
   - xv. Referring to the Technical Oversight Board any issues that deal with
     failure to follow established technical governance, issues that impact
     multiple OCI Projects or specifications, or conflicts that cannot be
     resolved within the TDC. Issues shall be referred to the TOB according to
     the requirements in Section 6.; and
   - xvi. Any issues of non-compliance with the OCI IP Policy shall be
     immediately referred to The Linux Foundation.

c. The maintainers and contributors shall set the technical direction of the
   OCI Projects, with minimal interference by the Technical Oversight Board;

d. The TDC will only accept influence through contribution. The primary means
   for any organization to influence the technical direction of the OCI
   Projects is via contribution or service as maintainers. OCI Members
   specifically disclaim any right to influence technical direction either on
   the basis of their financial contributions or their existence as OCI
   Members;

e. The maintainers of the TDC shall be those listed in the MAINTAINERS file in
   the project repository, available at
   (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencontainers/specs/master/MAINTAINERS).

## 6. Technical Oversight Board (TOB)

a. The TOB is responsible for managing conflicts, violations of procedures or
   guidelines and any cross-project or high-level issues that cannot be
   resolved in the TDC for OCI Projects. The TOB shall also be responsible for
   adding, removing or reorganizing OCI Projects. The TOB shall not dictate or
   interfere with the day-to-day work of individual OCI Projects or their
   decisions.

b. The TOB shall be responsible for adopting any policies related to the scope
   of the TOB and ensuring they are documented publicly.

c. The TOB shall operate transparently with any discussions and mailing lists
   open to the community. The TOB may choose to set up a private discussion or
   mailing list if a situation warrants a private discussion (e.g. removing a
   TOB member, addressing a legal issue), but the general expectation is that
   the TOB’s discussions and decisions are open to the OCI Community. If a
   decision is made in private, the TOB must follow all quorum and voting
   requirements as normally required and shall be responsible for notifying the
   OCI Community of the decision and rationale. Any private meeting of the TOB
   shall also require a representative from The Linux Foundation to ensure this
   option is not being abused.

d. While the initial TDC shall have one TDC, as the OCI evolves, the TOB may
   decide to establish a TDC per OCI Project, requiring contributors to earn
   maintainer status independently within each OCI Project in which they wish
   to participate.

e. The TOB shall be composed of nine (9) individuals elected for their
   expertise, contribution to the advancement of container technologies and are
   considered to be thought leaders in the OCI ecosystem. Anyone may be elected
   to the TOB, regardless of whether the individual is an employee of an OCI
   Member, so long as they are an OCI TDC participant. A TOB member is elected
   as an individual and not as a representative of his or her employer. No more
   than two (2) TOB members may be employed by the same entity or its
   affiliates. Affiliates shall be defined as entities owning 50% or more of an
   entity, or owned by or under common ownership with each other. TOB members
   may not designate alternative representatives.

f. TOB members shall be split into two (2) groups, serving for a term of two
   (2) years on a staggered basis, where one group is elected each year. The
   initial TOB will have four (4) TOB members who will only serve for a term of
   one year and five (5) TOB members that serve for a term of two (2) years.

g. The initial TOB shall be established through a nomination and election
   process. The first group from which four (4) TOB members shall be elected,
   will be nominated and elected by the current TDC maintainers, initially
   identified in Section 4(e), and serve for a period of one (1) year. Each TDC
   maintainer may nominate up to two (2) candidates for election, except that
   only one (1) nominee may be employed by the TDC maintainer’s own company.
   The second group from which five (5) TOB members shall be elected, will be
   nominated and elected by the OCI Members and serve for a period of two (2)
   years. Each OCI Member may nominate one (1) candidate for election.

h. Initial elections of TOB members shall be run using the Condorcet-IRV method
   through the Cornell online service (http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/). The TOB
   may change the methodology or service used in future elections via a
   two-thirds approval vote of the then-serving TOB.

i. The TOB shall elect a TOB Chair. The nominee with the most votes from the
   TOB members shall win the Chair position for a term of one (1) year. In the
   event of a tie vote, a random selection process (e.g. coin toss) shall be
   used to determine the winner. The TOB Chair shall have the responsibility to
   call meetings of the TOB and set TOB meeting agendas with input from TOB
   members.

j. The TOB shall meet on an as-needed basis, in a timely manner after issues
   are directed to the TOB from:

   - i. the TDC by a simple majority vote of the maintainers when there is an
     issue that needs the resolution to assist the TDC to move forward,
   - ii. as the TOB determines via vote of at least two-thirds of the TOB
     members
   - iii. the TOB Chair determines a meeting is necessary.

k. TOB meetings may be held in-person or via telephone or electronic
   conferencing.

l. Issues should be referred to the TOB sufficiently in advance of a meeting to
   provide an appropriate time for TOB members to evaluate the issues, and the
   positions of the TDC, the positions of users, as well as sufficient time to
   explore compromise solutions. It is expected an appropriate review should
   require at least a two-week review period, though it is recognized some
   timecritical circumstances may call for a shorter review (e.g. security
   issues).

m. Quorum for holding meetings shall be established when two-thirds of TOB
   members are present.

n. The intention is for the TOB to operate by consensus. However, if consensus
   cannot be achieved, the Trademark Board shall vote on a decision. All TOB
   Votes, either at TOB meetings, via email or electronic voting service, shall
   pass with a two-thirds vote of votes cast, on a one (1) vote per TOB member
   basis. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.

o. Any issues that cannot be resolved by the TOB shall be referred to The Linux
   Foundation Executive Director for mediation, and, if necessary, for
   resolution by The Linux Foundation Board of Directors.

## 7. OCI Values.

The TDC and TOB shall strive to reflect and adhere to the following values
(“OCI Values”) for OCI Projects:

a. Composable. All tools for downloading, installing, and running containers
   should be well integrated, but independent and composable. A container
   runtime should not be bound to clients, to higher-level frameworks, etc.

b. Portable. The runtime standard should be usable across different hardware,
   operating systems, and cloud environments.

c. Secure. Isolation should be pluggable, and the cryptographic primitives for
   strong trust, image auditing and application identity should be solid.

d. Decentralized. Discovery of container images should be simple and facilitate
   a federated namespace and distributed retrieval.

e. Open. The format and runtime should be well-specified and developed by a
   community. OCI encourages independent implementations of tools to be able to
   run the same container consistently. Within the OCI Community, code
   development leads specification development, rather than vice-versa. The OCI
   Community seeks rough consensus and running code.

f. Minimalist. The OCI Specifications should aim to do a few things well, be
   minimal and stable, and enable innovation and experimentation above and
   around it.

g. Backward compatible. The first version of the OCI Specification should
   strive to be backwards compatible with the initial container image format
   and runtime contribution. OCI Specifications and code should strive to be
   backward compatible with the prior releases of the OCI Specification.

## 8. OCI IP Policy.

a. All new inbound contributions to OCI will be made under the Apache License,
   Version 2.0 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
   accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
   (http://developercertificate.org). All contributions by Member employees
   will bind their employers in accordance with this policy, including the
   patent and copyright license grants in the Apache License, Version 2.0.

b. All outbound code and documentation will be made available under the Apache
   License, Version 2.0.

c. If an alternative inbound or outbound license is required for compliance
   with the license for a leveraged open source project, is otherwise required
   to achieve OCI’s mission or is in the best interests of OCI, the TOB may
   approve the use of an alternative license for inbound or outbound
   contributions on an exception basis. Please email tob@opencontainers.org to
   obtain exception approval.

d. Upon finalization and release of a new version of any OCI specification, OCI
   will notify all Members in writing using the contact information provided in
   Exhibit A. As set forth in Section 12 of this Charter, Members may resign
   from membership in OCI at any time within thirty (30) days following such
   notification to avoid undertaking further obligations with respect to such
   specification. All Members on the date thirty (30) days following such
   notification will, without further action, be subject to the obligations set
   forth in the Open Web Foundation Final Specification Agreement (OWFa 1.0)
   (Patent Only) with respect to such specification.
   http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owfa-1-0—patent-only

e. On the effective date of their membership, all Members will, without further
   action, be subject to the obligations set forth in the OWFa 1.0 (Patent
   Only) with respect to the current and one immediately prior version of all
   OCI specifications, a version being a numerically designated version of the
   specification formally released following the thirty day period provided for
   in (d) above. Each new version of the specification will be designated by a
   change in the number to the left of the decimal point (x in an x.y format
   where y designates interim update releases).

## 9. Antitrust Guidelines

a. All Members shall abide by The Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available
   at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy.

b. All Members shall encourage open participation from any organization able to
   meet the membership requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put
   another way, the OCI shall not seek to exclude any entity or any individual
   from OCI membership or OCI Project participation based on any criteria,
   requirements or reasons other than reasonable and appropriate criteria and
   requirements approved under this Charter and applied in a nondiscriminatory
   fashion to all.

## 10. Budget

a. The Trademark Board shall approve an annual budget and never commit to spend
   in excess of OCI membership and other OCI directed funds raised byThe Linux
   Foundation from all sources, including OCI membership fees. The budget and
   all OCI activities shall be consistent with the non-profit mission of The
   Linux Foundation.

b. So long as funds are sufficient, the OCI Budget shall include funds for a
   parttime program manager, or at the Trademark Board’s discretion, an
   Executive Director, to assist OCI with project management, organizing
   meetings and assisting in driving initiatives of the Trademark Board, TDC or
   TOB.

c. The Linux Foundation shall provide regular reports of spend levels against
   the budget.

d. The Linux Foundation shall have custody of and final authority over the
   usage of all OCI fees, funds and other cash receipts. To the extent that OCI
   acquires ownership in any intellectual property, ownership shall reside in
   The Linux Foundation.

## 11. The Linux Foundation General Rules and Operations.

The OCI, and as appropriate, its Members and participants, shall operate under
such rules and policies as may from time to time be applicable to Linux
Foundation hosted projects, and, in addition, shall:

a. demonstrate plans and the means to coordinate with the TDC, including on
   topics such as branding, logos, and other collateral that will represent the
   OCI Community;

b. engage in a professional manner consistent with maintaining a cohesive
   community, while also maintaining the goodwill and esteem of The Linux
   Foundation in the open source software community;

c. respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any branding and usage
   guidelines;

d. engage The Linux Foundation for all OCI press and analyst relations
   activities;

e. upon request, provide information regarding OCI Project participation,
   including information regarding attendance, to The Linux Foundation;

f. engage The Linux Foundation for creation and management of any websites
   relating directly to the OCI; and

g. operate under such rules and procedures as may from time to time be approved
   by the OCI and confirmed by The Linux Foundation Board of Directors.

## 12. Amendments and Notice

a. This Charter may be amended by a two thirds vote of the Technical Oversight
   Board, subject to veto by The Linux Foundation Board of Directors for
   reasonable cause, with thirty (30) days’ notice to the OCI Members before
   taking effect.

b. A Member may resign within such thirty-day notice period, or within the
   period provided for in Section 8 (d) of this Charter, to avoid undertaking
   any obligations imposed by any such amendment, or further obligations with
   respect to a specification, on a going forward basis. Such resignation will
   not have any effect on commitments made by the OCI Member or participant
   during the term of membership. Resignation may be made by email to the
   Executive Director of the Linux Foundation.

c. Each version of this Charter will have a distinguishing version number, with
   a changelog included in the preamble describing material changes to the
   Charter.

d. In order to facilitate collaborative development of this Charter, draft
   versions of this Charter may be indicated by the suffix "+DRAFT" added to
   the version number. These Charter versions are not enforceable, and the most
   recently published non-draft Charter remains in effect until a newer
   non-draft Charter is published. For the avoidance of doubt, amendments to a
   draft Charter still must go through the same process as amendments to a
   non-draft Charter (as described in Section 12 (a) of this Charter).
